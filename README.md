## üìù Before usage

How does it work? 

First of all, you need to login to your account and join server that you want to scrape.
It can't be done automaticly because discord bans your account :(.

Than, add all of servers id in the config, or leave it empty to scrape all servers you are in.

The second problem is - discord asks captcha for each dm request, the only service i found is https://24captcha.online/,
the price here is 0.5$ for 1000 captchas, so it's not that expensive.

Go to this site, register, top up your balance and get your api key, than put it in the config.

When you start the bot it will listen to messages and send dm's to all active users who are writing in the chat.
